we have 280 euros
we want to know how many 100 euros how many 50 how many 20 and how many 10 there is inside
280/100 result 2 rest 80
rest /50 result 1 rest 30
rest/20 result 1 rest 10
rest/10 result 1

amt - quotient = 80

rest = (amt-quotient)/50

quotient2 = (amt-100*quotient)/50

quotient3 =(amt-100*quotient-50*quotient2)/20

quotient4= (amt-100*quotient-50*quotient2-20*quotient3)/10
